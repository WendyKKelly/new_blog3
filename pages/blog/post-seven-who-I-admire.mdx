## I Would Like to Thank:

- Next.js:
    - [Loren Sean Stewart] (https://github.com/lorenseanstewart/nextjs-mdx-blog-kit) => I had finished the Next.js tutorials. I had finished [Stephen Grider's] (https://twitter.com/ste_grider?lang=en) React/Redux tutorial on Udemy. I wanted a simple solution for this project and through a forum conversation, was given the idea to use MDX. After some searching, I stumbled upon Loren Sean Stewart's open source github repo and used it as a base.
    - [Flavio Copes] (https://flaviocopes.com/svg/) for so many things. Specifically on this project, his Next.js tutorial really helped steer me in the right direction.
    - [JavaScript Teacher] (https://twitter.com/js_tut?lang=en) for inspiration, encouragement via Twitter :) and insight into how things are done.
    - [Zeit.com] (https://zeit.com). The more I learn about Zeit, the more I want to be in their orbit.

- SVG image on home page:
    - [Sara Soueidan] (https://www.sarasoueidan.com/) for inspiration and detailed explanations. Especially helpful information on grouping.
    - MDN for detailed help with all aspects of SVG. The flower is based heavily on a tutorial I found on MDN.
    - [CSS-Tricks] (https://css-tricks.com/) for detailed explanation about adding text to SVG.

- Font choices:
    - Font Squirrel and [Flying Hippo] (https://www.flyinghippo.com/blog/10-web-fonts-write-home/). tl;dr: I was really stuck. I knew I wanted readable. That's all I knew. After reading Flying Hippo's description of Tisa, I was sold. Thank you, flying Hippo.

- Emoji love:
    - [Sean McPherson] (https://medium.com/@seanmcp/%EF%B8%8F-how-to-use-emojis-in-react-d23bbf608bf7) This article explained everything I needed to understand about how emojis should and should not be added to a react environment. Was I surprised that the basic idea was to add a component? No.

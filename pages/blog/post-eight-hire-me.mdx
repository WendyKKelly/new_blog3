# I'm For Hire

Writing: I write fast, to deadline, and solidly. I revise cheerfully and (pretty much) as often as necessary. I write up and down and horizontally to spec (in other words I write to your audience and that can be several different audiences if you'd like)

- I incorporate SEO best practices in all digital content
- I can slice and dice a content piece into several assets
- I'm told I am easy to work with and a "high value asset"
- I'm also told I am high on empathy and a true team player :) <= I'd like to think so.

Teaching: I love to inspire a love of writing and language in people of all ages. Inquire :)

Front End Development: I have been learning and learning and have started to be paid for this. Please inquire. I am interested in doing more of this work.

- HTML / CSS
- JavaScript
- React / Redux

This site is (I think) a good example of what I can do. Please see the acknowledgement post for details but in general, this is my "portfolio".

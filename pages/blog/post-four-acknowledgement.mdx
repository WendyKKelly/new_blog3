 Until this point in my life, I have been paid mainly to teach and write. Though there have been lovely encouraging people who have mentored me in both these fields, it's also true that much of it was learned solo and by traditional means. In other words, thank you Hemingway, thank you Milton, thank you Stephen King (etc). For this craft-change, it's been strikingly different. Hopefully, the physical people who've mentored me know who you are :) But the on-line folks who have helped me out often in the middle of the night **without their knowledge** <3 Man, do I want to say thank you to them. For this latest project (which I feel shows "well enough" what I know but also tells the story of how much I have to learn...) there were so many folks online who came through for me and have no idea that they did that. I find that a bit weird. So I would like to take a moment to say thank you to them, below. And I bet there are more...many exist on Twitter, but if I looked through the thousands of bookmarked pages over the last couple weeks, I'm sure there'd be plenty of more folks to thank. Onward:

# I Would Like to Thank:

- Next.js:
    - [Loren Sean Stewart] (https://github.com/lorenseanstewart/nextjs-mdx-blog-kit) => I had finished the Next.js tutorials. I had finished [Stephen Grider's] (https://twitter.com/ste_grider?lang=en) React/Redux tutorial on Udemy. I wanted a simple solution for this project and through a forum conversation, was given the idea to use MDX. After some searching, I stumbled upon Loren Sean Stewart's open source github repo and used it as a base.
    - [Flavio Copes] (https://flaviocopes.com/svg/) for so many things. Specifically on this project, his Next.js tutorial really helped steer me in the right direction.
    - [JavaScript Teacher] (https://twitter.com/js_tut?lang=en) for inspiration, encouragement via Twitter :) and insight into how things are done.
    - [Zeit.com] (https://zeit.com). The more I learn about Zeit, the more I want to be in their orbit.

- SVG image on home page:
    - [Sara Soueidan] (https://www.sarasoueidan.com/) for inspiration and detailed explanations. Especially helpful information on grouping.
    - MDN for detailed help with all aspects of SVG. The flower is based heavily on a tutorial I found on MDN.
    - [CSS-Tricks] (https://css-tricks.com/) for detailed explanation about adding text to SVG.

- Font choices:
    - Font Squirrel and [Flying Hippo] (https://www.flyinghippo.com/blog/10-web-fonts-write-home/). tl;dr: I was really stuck. I knew I wanted readable. That's all I knew. After reading Flying Hippo's description of Tisa, I was sold. Thank you, flying Hippo.

- Emoji love:
    - [Sean McPherson] (https://medium.com/@seanmcp/%EF%B8%8F-how-to-use-emojis-in-react-d23bbf608bf7) This article explained everything I needed to understand about how emojis should and should not be added to a react environment. Was I surprised that the basic idea was to add a component? No.

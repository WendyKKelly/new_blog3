## Katelyn Ohashi, Gymnastics, & Joy

I'm afraid I am going to mangle this. Okay. Gotta start somewhere. So: First, years after the concept of blogging started, I am acutely aware of how odd it is. In context: Who, really is the audience here?
Any other time I have blogged on a personal website, I have come up with a few ground rules to create a false set of constraints. In this case, I really just want to get started, so I am simply going to respond to a few things that happened recently, outline why I chose to create this blog, and get started. So: Last year at this time, I had decided to take a deep dive into front end development. My trajectory was still vague. I knew I liked the idea of creating digital stuff. I knew I wanted to tell stories with data. I knew I enjoyed sitting still for hours trying to solve problems. Beyond that, I just dove in and started to swim.

I feel compelled to admit that I had taken the odd course from Udemy, SitePoint, and Coursera already. I had made "websites" -- in fact, truthfully, I had been flirting with this for years. What changed? The weird series of events that twigged this deep dive were:

- Learning Icelandic
- Free Site Point subscription
- My StoryPower website

Those three things came together like this: I had been learning Icelandic for about a year by that point. I loved it, and was really beginning to get the hang of it. I was at the point where I needed to start making Icelandic friends and immerse myself in the culture...and, well, that was proving difficult. I paused a bit and sort of looked around. I realized that aside from an arcane love of the country, of the way the language sounded, and a deepening admiration for the culture, I was really spending an awful lot of time learning something that would give me very few benefits in "real world terms" as they say.


So the second and third bits on my list kind of reared their heads at that point and it occurred to me that if I spent as much time learning a programming language, I might actually get more "real world benefits". Weirdly, I also got addicted to practicing. I realized that I had allowed myself to stay at a very beginning level for far too long out of fear or lack of confidence or something...but as soon as I sat still for 15 hours a day, nearly every day, the scales began to fall from my eyes as it were. I started to see what was possible. I stopped fearing stuff like the terminal and git. I started taking myself more seriously and striving for more elegant code, better solutions. I stopped caring what people who are not in this industry said to me. And then I got a lovely writing contract. A really lovely contract with really lovely people at a really lovely company. I put aside most of my coding goals, dove into the contract, and decided to make the most of what I could learn at this gig. In a very "the-universe-is trying-to-tell-you-something" way, at crucial times, reports I wrote were not read, things that were really important were not heard in the way I intended, and the contract began to feel like a misstep. In a frankly odd way, {honestly, is it possible that Mercury was permanently in retrograde during this contract? I jest....but seriously, that is what it felt like much of the time.}
